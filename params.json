{"name":"AH-Oâ‚‚","tagline":"Breathing new life to the WordPress admin","body":"![ah-o2](https://raw2.github.com/jazzsequence/WordPress-Admin-Help/master/assets/banner-1544x500.jpg)\r\n\r\n##What is AH-O&#8322;?\r\n\r\nAH-O&#8322; is a WordPress feature plugin project that's been in the works since August 2013. Our goal is to revitalize and rethink how admin help is presented in the WordPress admin and ultimately included in WordPress 4.0.\r\n\r\n##What's it do?\r\n\r\nAH-O&#8322; adds two configurable help options to enable/disable help overviews and tooltips.\r\n\r\n**Help overviews** appear at the top of every page and explain what the current page can be used for.\r\n\r\n**Tooltips** appear when hovering over specific items as you navigate the WordPress admin and are intended to give specific information relevant to that task/item about the intended use/functionality.\r\n\r\n###Who are you?\r\n\r\nThe core contributors to the AH-O&#8322; project are:\r\n\r\n@jazzsequence  \r\n@brainfork  \r\n@mdbitz  \r\n@ninnypants  \r\n@trishasalas\r\n\r\n...and a number of other people who contribute to the discussions via the [make.wordpress.org p2s](http://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/admin-help/) or in IRC.\r\n\r\n###How do I get involved?\r\n\r\n* You can test the plugin either by downloading it from WordPress.org or on GitHub. \r\n* You can report issues in our ticket tracker\r\n* You can join the discussions on the make/docs or make/ui P2s\r\n* You can join us in #wordpress-sfd on Freenode every Monday at 18:30UTC\r\n* You can hop onto [Gitter (Git chat client)](https://gitter.im/jazzsequence/WordPress-Admin-Help) and request access or ask for more information.\r\n* You can request access to the [AH-O&#8322; group on Google](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ah-o2).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
